Key Management System for [Tendermint] applications, initially targeting
[Cosmos Validators].

## About

This repository contains `tmkms`, a key management service intended to be deployed
in conjunction with [Tendermint] applications (ideally on separate physical hosts)
which provides the following:

- **High-availability** access to validator signing keys
- **Double-signing** prevention even in the event the validator process is compromised
- **Hardware security module** storage for validator keys which can survive host compromise

## Status

Tendermint KMS is currently **beta quality**.

It supports [YubiHSM 2] and [Ledger] as hardware-backed key storage methods.

### Security Issues

The following high severity security issues are still unresolved:

- [#111: AuthZ for signing key usage](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/issues/111)
- [#142: MITM in secret connection](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/issues/142)

Work is underway to address them both.

For now we recommend the connection between the KMS and validators occur over
an isolated network and not depend solely on the Secret Connection protocol for
authentication and confidentiality (which is also a good idea in general for
defense-in-depth purposes).

### Double Signing / High Availability

Tendermint KMS does NOT yet implement double signing prevention or high
availability features. Please see the following issues to track progress:

- [#60: Double-signing prevention (MVP for launch)](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/issues/60)
- [#115: Dobule signing prevention (post-launch)](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/issues/115)
- [#193: State tracking for double sign protection](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/pull/193)

## Supported Platforms

`tmkms` should build on any [supported Rust platform] which is also supported
by [libusb]. Below are some of the available tier 1, 2, and 3 Rust platforms
which are also supported by **libusb**.

NOTE: `tmkms` is presently tested on Linux/x86_64. We don't otherwise guarantee
support for any of the platforms below, but they theoretically meet the necessary
prerequisites for support.

### Operating Systems

- Linux (recommended)
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD
- macOS

### CPU Architectures

- `x86_64` (recommended)
- `arm` (32-bit ARM)
- `aarch64` (64-bit ARM)
- `mips` (32-bit MIPS)
- `mips64` (64-bit MIPS)
- `powerpc` (32-bit PowerPC)
- `powerpc64` (64-bit PowerPC)
- `sparc64` (64-bit SPARC)

## Installation

You will need the following prerequisites:

- **Rust** (stable; 1.31+): https://rustup.rs/
- **C compiler**: e.g. gcc, clang
- **pkg-config**
- **libusb** (1.0+). Install instructions for common platforms:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
  - RedHat/CentOS: `yum install libusb1-devel`
  - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install libusb`

NOTE (x86_64 only): Configure `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:
`export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes,+ssse3`

There are two ways to install `tmkms`: either compiling the source code after
cloning it from git, or using Rust's `cargo install` command.

### Compiling from source code (via git)

`tmkms` can be compiled directly from the git repository source code using the
following method.

The following example adds `--features=yubihsm` to enable YubiHSM 2 support.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tendermint/kms.git && cd kms
[...]
$ cargo build --release --features=yubihsm
```

Alternatively, substitute `--features=ledgertm` to enable Ledger support.

If successful, this will produce a `tmkms` executable located at
`./target/release/tmkms`

### Installing with the `cargo install` command

With Rust (1.31+) installed, you can install tmkms with the following:

```
cargo install tmkms --features=yubihsm
```

Or to install a specific version (recommended):

```
cargo install tmkms --features=yubihsm --version=0.4.0
```

Alternatively, substitute `--features=ledgertm` to enable Ledger support.

## YubiHSM 2 Setup Instructions

[Please see README.yubihsm.md](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/blob/master/README.yubihsm.md)

## Usage

After compiling, start `tmkms` with the following:


```
$ tmkms start
```

This will read the configuration from the `tmkms.toml` file in the current
working directory.

To explicitly specify the path to the configuration, use the `-c` flag:

```
$ tmkms start -c /path/to/tmkms.toml
```

## Development

The following are instructions for setting up a development environment.
They assume you've already followed steps 1 & 2 from the Installation
section above.

- Install **rustfmt**: `rustup component add rustfmt`
- Install **clippy**: `rustup component add clippy`

Alternatively, you can build a Docker image from the [Dockerfile] in the top
level of the repository, which is what is used to run tests in CI.

Before opening a pull request, please run the checks below:

### Testing

Run the test suite with:

```
cargo test --all-features
```

### Format checking (rustfmt)

Make sure your code is well-formatted by running:

```
cargo fmt
```

### Lint (clippy)

Lint your code (i.e. check it for common issues) with:

```
cargo clippy
```
